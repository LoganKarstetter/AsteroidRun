# AsteroidRun
A original game I’ve been developing in Java since February 2018. This game features animated sprites, custom artwork, an animation framework, active rendering, double buffering, and accepts a single integer command line argument to specify the desired FPS. In the game, the user flies a space ship through a field of asteroids (they’re apples right now). The ship’s movement can be controlled by the left and right arrow keys, and the ESC key will quit the game. If the ship is hit by an asteroid the game is over. The game can also be paused by taking focus away from the window. This game is still very much a work in progress, but feel free to play it!
