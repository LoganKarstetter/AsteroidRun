# AsteroidRun
An original Java game I developed from February to April of 2018. The game features animated sprites, custom artwork, an animation framework, active rendering, and double buffering. It also accepts an integer command line argument to specify the desired FPS. In the game the user flies a space ship through a field of asteroids. If the ship is hit by an asteroid the ships "shields" will decrease. Once the shields are fully depleted, the next hit will result in the ship being "destroyed" (i.e. game over). The ship’s movement can be controlled with the left and right arrow keys, and the ESC key will quit the game. There is no objective to the game other than to see how long you can survive. If the game gets too intense, it can be paused by simply taking focus away from the window. Good luck!

Note: All of the game’s artwork was created by me and can be found under AsteroidRun/src/Images if you wish to print and frame any of my masterpieces above/on your mantle/fireplace/bedside table.
