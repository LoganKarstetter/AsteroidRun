# AsteroidRun
An original game I developed in Java from February to April of 2018. The game features animated sprites, custom artwork, an animation framework, active rendering, double buffering, and accepts an integer command line argument to specify the desired FPS. In the game the user flies a space ship through a field of asteroids. The shipâ€™s movement can be controlled with the left and right arrow keys, and the ESC key will quit the game. If the ship is hit by an asteroid the ships "shields" will decrease. Once the shields are fully depleted, the next hit will result in the ship being "destroyed" (i.e. game over). There is no objective to the game other than to see how long you can survive. If you wish, the game can also be paused by taking focus away from the window.
